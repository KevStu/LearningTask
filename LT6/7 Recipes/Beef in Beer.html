    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons beef drippings or butter, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 pounds/1.5 kg sirloin tip, cut into fat fingers</li>
        <li>3 large onions, sliced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups/375 ml beef stock</li>
        <li>2 cups/500 ml beer</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red-wine vinegar</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 bouquet garni</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1.	Heat the beef drippings and oil together in a saute pan.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, brown the beef strips on all sides. <br>Remove from the pan. In the same pan, fry the onions until soft, about 15 minutes, then add the garlic for 1 minute. </li>
        <li>Remove. (Check if there is fat in the pan. If not, add a good tablespoon of butter and let it melt.) <br> Add the flour and sugar to the pan and cook for 1 minute to make a roux. </li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the stock and bring to a boil. <br>(At this point, turn the oven on to 325 degrees F/160 degrees C.) </li>
        <li>Add the beer and vinegar to the boiling stock, and bring back to a boil, cooking until thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>In a large casserole dish, layer the onions alternately with the beef strips, seasoning each layer as you go with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Tuck in the bouquet garni and pour the sauce over. Cover and bake for 2 1/2 hours. </li>
        <li>If you can wait a day before eating, cool the dish completely when it's out of the oven and refrigerate overnight:<br> the flavor will be even better when you reheat it.</li>
    </ul>
