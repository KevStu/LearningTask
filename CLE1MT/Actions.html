        <p>The actions that I could see that has the possibility of solving these social issue in our country.
            Is that we should or the government should create opportunities to the people. I know it is easier said
            than done there is a lot of facotrs that can affect in this action. We can also build infrastructures that 
            can also help the people. The last option that I can see is that we could 
            take advantage of being a developing country. Since national certificate(NC's) is available for us through TESDA training as short as 6 months 
            we can claim a national certificate and be a qualified worker. Then again, it is up to the people whether they are willing to work or succumb to
            their laziness. The Filipino people have this mindset of 'easy money' but we have to work the government can do as much we need to do the rest.
            Work and idea is the key in solving this issue.
